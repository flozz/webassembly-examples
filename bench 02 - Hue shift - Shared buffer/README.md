This benchmark mesure the impact on the speed of the memory allocation calls.


## Files

Source files:

* `bench.js`: The code to run the benchmark.
* `image.jpg`: An image that will be modified by the JS and the WASM.
* `index.html`: The HTML page that host the benchmark.
* `lib.c`: The benchmarked functions.
* `Makefile`: The makefile to compile the WebAssembly part of the project.

Generated files:

* `build/lib.wasm.js`: The compiled version of the C code (contains both the WASM module and the JS glue code generated by Emscripted).
