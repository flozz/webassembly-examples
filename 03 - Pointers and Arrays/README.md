# 03 - Pointers and Arrays

This is an example that shows how to use pointers and how to pass arrays to a WebAssembly function.


## Files

Source file:

* `example.c`: The C program to compile to WebAssembly
* `index.html`: Our HTML page
* `script.js`: Our JavaScript script
* `image.jpg`: An image that will be modified by the WASM function.
* `Makefile`: The makefile to compile the WebAssembly part of the project

Generated files:

* `build/example.wasm.js`: The file that contains both our WebAssembly program and the JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten.


## Build this project

You will first need to install GNU Make and Emscripten. On Ubuntu this can be done with the following command:

    sudo apt install build-essential emscripten

Then, just run the make command:

    make


## Run the project

Serve files with an HTTP server and open the URI in your browser.

If you have Python installed you can run:

    make serve

Then open http://localhost:8000/
