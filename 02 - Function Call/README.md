# 02 - Call WASM functions from JavaScript

This is an example that shows how to call WebAssembly functions from JavaScript.


## Files

Source file:

* `example.c`: The C program to compile to WebAssembly
* `index.html`: Our HTML page
* `script.js`: Our JavaScript script
* `Makefile`: The makefile to compile the WebAssembly part of the project

Generated files:

* `build/example.wasm.js`: The file that contains both our WebAssembly program and the JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten.

    sudo apt install build-essential emscripten

Then, just run the make command:
