# Benchmark 03 - Hue shift

This benchmark mesure the speed difference between a pure JavaScrupt and a WebAssembly versions of a hue shift on a canvas.

* `image.jpg`: An image that will be modified by the JS and the WASM.
* `index.html`: The HTML page that host the benchmark.
* `lib.c`: The C version of the benchmarked functions.
* `lib.js`: The JavaScript version of the benchmarked functions.
* `Makefile`: The makefile to compile the WebAssembly part of the project.

Generated files:

* `build/lib.wasm.js`: The compiled version of the C code (contains both the WASM module and the JS glue code generated by Emscripted).
